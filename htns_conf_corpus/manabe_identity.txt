Abstract—Identity 
detection 
is 
the 
key 
process 
behind 
any 
biometric 
authentication 
system. 
In 
this 
work 
a 
novel 
approach 
for 
identity 
detection 
from 
temporal 
information 
is 
proposed 
from 
the 
analysis 
of 
nonlinear 
time 
series. 
The 
handwriting 
can 
be 
considered 
as 
a 
manifestation 
of 
biomechanics.

A

here 
to 
evaluate 
its 
effectiveness 
in 
detecting

of 
a

from 
his 
handwriting. 
Based 
on 
the 
proposed

an 
algorithm

has 
been 
proposed. 
The

done 
with

is 
quite 
effective 
for 
biometric 
authentication. 


I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Knowledge 
extraction 
from 
the 
analysis 
of 
human 
body 
movement 
has 
been 
approached 
in 
various 
fields 
such 
as 
data 
mining, 
biomechanics, 
human 
interface, 
robotics, 
cognitive 
science 
etc. 
Recently 
physiological 
and 
behavioral 
characteristics 
of 
a 
person 
popularly 
known 
as 
Biometrics 
[1] 
are 
increasinglyusedforpersonauthenticationforsecuritypurposes. 
Though 
current 
biometric 
systems 
mostly 
use 
static 
biometric 
data 
such 
as 
fingerprint, 
iris 
or 
face, 
dynamic 
biometric 
data 
from 
body 
movement 
can 
also 
be 
considered 
to 
possess 
better 
potential 
in 
certain 
applications. 
Online 
handwritten 
signature 
can 
be 
considered 
as 
a 
behavioural 
biometric 
attribute 
produced 
by 
the 
dynamics 
of 
human 
hand 
movement 
and 
is 
a 
possible 
candidate 
for 
identity 
detection. 
Unlike 
iris, 
fingerprint 
and 
retina 
which 
do 
not 
change 
over 
time 
and 
difficult 
to 
forge, 
handwritten 
signature 
has 
higher 
intra 
class 
variation 
leading 
to 
poor 
verification 
performance. 
But 
its 
acquisition 
is 
relatively 
simple 
and 
inexpensive 
compared 
to 
other 
biometrics. 
Moreover 
its 
widespread 
acceptance 
by 
the 
public, 
made 
it 
popular 
for 
a 
large 
number 
of 
authentication 
needs. 


The 
detection 
of 
identity 
from 
handwritten 
signature 
is 
not 
a 
new 
research 
topic 
and 
signature 
verification 
techniques 
for 
person 
authentication 
have 
a 
long 
history 
[2] 
[3] 
[4]. 
The 
handwriting 
can 
be 
analysed 
in 
two 
ways, 
off-line 
(from 
static 
features) 
and 
on-line 
(from 
dynamic 
features). 
In 
off-
line 
system, 
signature 
is 
caputured 
by 
scanning 
to 
get

static 
digital 
image 
and 
image 
based 
techniques 
are 
used 
for 
processing. 
On 
line 
signature 
verification 
system 
captures 
the 
pen 
trajectory 
or 
the 
dynamics 
of 
the 
writing 
process 
for 
further 
processing 
(signal 
based). 


Automatic 
writer 
authentication 
methods 
using 
online 
handwriting 
are 
broadly 
classified 
into 
two 
categories 
: 
feature 
based 
approaches 
and 
function 
based 
approaches. 
In 
feature 
based 
approaches 
[5] 
[6], 
a 
vector 
representation 
of 
a 
set 
of 
global 
features 
abstraced 
from 
the 
signature 
trajectory 
is 
used. 
Though 
they 
are 
simpler 
with 
high 
computation 
speed 
but 
task 
ofselectingrightfeatures 
isdifficultandduringtheprocessing, 
the 
dynamical 
information 
is 
lost. 
In 
functional 
approach, 
the 
two 
complete 
signals 
describing 
the 
local 
properties 
of 
the 
signature, 
one 
from 
a 
genuine 
and 
the 
other 
from 
a 
forgery, 
are 
compared 
point-to-point 
which 
generally 
yields 
better 
results 
[7][8]. 
Function 
based 
approaches 
can 
be 
classified 
into 
local 
and 
regional 
methods. 
In 
local 
approaches, 
for 
the 
past 
two 
decades, 
DP 
matching 
algorithm 
and 
its 
variants 
based 
on 
elastic 
distance 
measures 
such 
as 
DTW 
(Dynamic 
Time 
Warping) 
to 
find 
the 
best 
matching 
path 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
least 
global 
cost, 
between 
an 
input 
signal 
and 
a 
template, 
has 
become 
a 
major 
technique 
in 
signature 
verification 
[9]. 
Though 
DTW 
is 
quite 
sucessful, 
it 
has 
two 
main 
drawbacks: 
heavy 
computational 
load 
and 
warping 
of 
forgeries. 
Among 
the 
regional 
approaches, 
popular 
recent 
methods 
are 
based 
on 
HMM 
[10] 
[11]. 


Online 
handwriting 
is 
captured 
by 
multivariable 
time 
series 
from 
pen 
trajectory. 
In 
this 
work 
we 
propose 
an 
approach 
for 
detecting 
the 
identity 
of 
a 
person 
from 
nonlinear 
time 
series 
analysis 
based 
on 
delay 
coordinate 
embedding. 
In 
our 
approach 
the 
non 
linear 
time 
series 
is 
represented 
by 
the 
reconstructed 
attractor 
of 
the 
underlying 
dynamical 
system 
with 
proper 
choice 
of 
embedding 
parameters. 
We 
also 
studied 
theeffectiveness 
of 
a 
similarity 
measure 
proposed 
earlier 
by 
us 


[12] 
[13] 
in 
detecting 
identity 
of 
a 
person 
from 
handwriting 
time 
series. 
Based 
on 
the 
proposed 
similarity 
measure, 
an 
efficient 
identity 
authentication 
algorithm 
for 
online 
signature 
verification 
has 
been 
evaluated 
by 
simulation 
experiments 
with 
data 
set 
of 
Signature 
Verification 
Contest 
2004 
(SVC 
2004) 
and 
has 
been 
compared 
with 
popular 
DTW 
algorithm 
from 
the 
viewpoint 
of 
verification 
accuracy 
and 
computational 
cost.

PROPOSED 
APPROACH 
FOR 
IDENTITY 
DETECTION 
1) 
Proposed 
Similarity 
Measure 
: 
CTE: 
The 
algorithm 
for 
We 
consider 
on-line 
handwritten 
signature 
as 
a 
multivariate 
time 
series 
signal 
generated 
by 
the 
pen 
movement 
on 
writing 
pad, 
the 
variables 
are 
x,y 
co-ordinates 
of 
pen-tip 
movement, 
writing 
pressure, 
pen 
inclination 
with 
respect 
to 
x 
and 
y 
coordinates 
etc. 
The 
path 
of 
the 
hand 
movement 
during 
pen-up 
position 
is 
also 
interpolated 
in 
the 
time 
series 
along 
with 
the 
movement 
of 
the 
pen-down 
position. 
The 
time 
series 
signal 
generated 
by 
online 
handwriting 
is 
considered 
to 
be 
originated 
from 
the 
dynamics 
of 
the 
hand 
movement. 
The 
trajectories 
of 
a 
writing 
piece 
of 
sample 
should 
be 
similar 
for 
the 
same 
writer 
but 
different 
for 
different 
writers 
as 
handwriting 
is 
considered 
to 
be 
dependent 
on 
individual. 


A. 
Nonlinear 
Time 
Series 
and 
Delay 
Coordinate 
Embedding 
Delay 
coordinate 
embedding 
is 
a 
standard 
approach 
for 
analysis 
and 
modelling 
of 
nonlinear 
time 
series. 
The 
relation 
between 
a 
time 
series 
and 
its 
underlying 
dynamical 
system 
can 
be 
expressed 
by 
the 
following 
equations; 



(1) 



(2) 



where 
is 
the 
state 
vector 
of 
the 
dynamical 
system 
at 
time 
, 
the 
function 
represents 
the 
state 
change 
of 
dynamical 
system. 
is 
the 
observed 
value 
at 
time 
while 
represents 
the 
observation 
function, 
and 
are 
dynamical 
noise 
and 
observational 
noise 
at 
time 
respectively. 
Eq. 
(1) 
and 
Eq. 
(2) 
represent 
that 
we 
cannot 
directly 
obtain 
the 
state 
of 
original 
dynamical 
system. 
Embedding 
theorem, 
developed 
by 
Takens 
[14] 
and 
expanded 
by 
Sauer 
et 
al. 
[15], 
guarantees 
that, 
an 
observed 
deterministic 
time 
series 
signal 



can 
be 
embedded 
as 
a 
sequence 
of 
time 
delay 
co-ordinate 
vector 
known 
as 
experimental 
attractor, 
with 
an 
appropriate 
choice 
of 
embedding 
dimension 
and 
delay 
time 
for 
reconstruction 
of 
the 
original 
dynamical 
system 
as 
follows: 
(3) 



For 
correct 
reconstruction, 
a 
fine 
estimation 
of 
the 
parameters 
is 
needed. 
There 
are 
variety 
of 
heuristic 
techniques 
for 
estimating 
embedding 
parameters, 
and 
, 
the 
details 
can 
be 
found 
in 
[15]. 


B. 
Identity 
Detection 
by 
Dynamic 
Similarity 
In 
order 
to 
detect 
identity 
of 
a 
person 
from 
handwriting 
time 
series 
we 
need 
to 
evaluate 
dynamic 
similarity 
between 
two 
time 
series. 
We 
proposed 
a 
novel 
measure 
Cross 
Translation 
Error: 
CTE 
for 
evaluating 
similarity 
of 
time 
series 
signals 
based 
on 
Translation 
Error, 
originally 
proposed 
by 
Wayland 
[16] 
for 
detecting 
determinism 
from 
a 
time 
series. 



calculating 
CTE 
for 
a 
test 
sample 
and 
a 
reference 
sample 
is 
described 
below. 


1) 
Multi-dimensional 
delay 
vector 
can 
be 
generated 
from 
time 
series 
based 
on 
Eq. 
(3). 
( 
) 
dimensional 
vector 
including 
the 
normalized 
time 
index 
is 
defined 
as 
follows; 
(4) 


2) 
Let 
and 
denote 
-dimensional 
delay 
vectors 
generated 
from 
input 
handwriting 
time 
series 
(test 
sample) 
and 
enrollment 
handwriting 
time 
series 
(reference 
sample) 
respectively. 
and 
denote 
the 
corresponding 
-dimensional 
vector 
including 
the 
normalized 
time 
index 
. 


3) 
A 
random 
vector 
is 
picked 
up 
from 
. 
Let 
the 
nearest 
vector 
of 
from 
be 
. 
The 
index 
for 
the 
nearest 
vector 
is 
defined 
as 
follows; 
(5) 


4) 
For 
the 
vectors 
and 
, 
the 
transition 
in 
the 
each 
orbit 
after 
one 
step 
are 
calculated 
as 
follows; 
(6) 
(7) 
5) 
Cross 
translation 
error 
is 
calculated 
from 
and 
as

where

average 
vector 
between 
and

6) 
is 
calculated 
for 
times 
for 
different 
selection 
of 
random 
vector 
and 
the 
median 
of 
( 
) 
is 
calculated 
as 


(9) 


The 
final 
cross 
translation 
error 
is 
calculated 
by 
taking 
the 
average, 
repeating 
the 
procedure 
times 
to 
suppress 
the 
statistical 
error 
generated 
by 
random 
sampling

used 
to

a

of 
intra

from

by

from 
the

of

It 
also

to

We 
compared 
our

with

(

[17] 
for

We 
also 
used 
Henon 
time

for 
comparing 
computational 
cost 
of 
our 
proposed 
measure 
and 
DTW. 


A. 
Data 
Description 
SVC 
2004 
data 
set 
contains 
two 
data 
sets; 
task1 
and 
task2. 
Task1 
data 
set 
includes 
mainly 
pen 
position 
( 
and 
) 
time 
series 
data. 
Task 
2 
data 
set 
includes 
pen 
position 
( 
and 
), 
pen 
pressure( 
), 
pen

time 
series 
data. 
We 
also 
used 
pen 
speed

) 
time 
series 
calculated 
from 
pen 
position. 
Total 
number 
of 
data 
is 
1600 
(40 
writers 
40 
signatures/writer). 
40 
signatures 
are 
divided 
into 
two 
classes; 
genuine 
signature 
set 
(S1 
to 
S20) 
and 
skilled 
forgery 
signature 
set 
(S21 
to 
S40). 
The 
data 
has 
been 
preprocessed 
to 
eliminate 
the 
sampled

as 
a 
redundant

and 
to

the

from

to

B. 
Simulation 
Experiment 
The 
experimental 
procedure 
is 
as 
follows: 


1) 
For 
a 
particular 
writer, 
5 
signatures 
from 
10 
genuine 
signatures 
(S1 
to 
S10) 
are 
randomly 
chosen 
for 
enrollment. 
2) 
Test 
signature 
of 
the 
writer 
to 
be 
verified 
is 
chosen 
one 
by 
one 
from 
remaining 
30 
signatures 
which 
include 
10 
genuinesignatures(S11toS20)and20fogerysignatures 
(S21 
to 
S40). 
3) 
Similarity 
between 
the 
input 
signature 
and 
each 
of 
the 
5 
enrollment 
signatures 
has 
been 
calculated 
by 
both 
CTE 
and 
DTW 
and 
the 
average 
is 
taken 
as 
the 
final 
similarity 
value. 
The 
above 
procedure 
is 
repeated 
10 
times 
for 
each 
of 
40 
writers 
by 
changing 
enrollment 
signature 
set 
each 
time. 
The 
verification 
accuracy 
is 
measureed 
by 
FAR 
( 
False 
Acceptance 
Rate)andFRR(FalseRejection 
Rate).Equal 
Error 
Rate(EER)

when 
FAR 
is

CTE 
is 
calculated 
according 
to 
the 
algorithm 
described 
previously 
for 
and 
with 
various 
embedding 
parameters 
(

for 
examining

relation 
between 
the 
multi-dimensional

vector 
and

Figure

and

show 
the 
average 
of 
EER 
(for 
all 
the 
writers) 
for 
various 
and 
for 
CTE 
measure 
and 
DTW 
measure 
respectively. 
In 
each 
graph, 
(A) 
and 
(B) 
show 
the 
result 
of 
time 
series 
and

respectively. 
Besides, 
table 
I 
shows 
several 
EERs 
(the 
minimum, 
the 
maximum 
and 
average 
of 
EER). 
From 
the 
results 
we 
find, 



In 
case 
of 
time 
series, 
CTE 
has 
slightly 
better 
perfomance 
than 
DTW. 
while 
for 
time 
series, 
DTW 
is 
better 
than 
CTE. 
EER 
is 
improved 
with 
larger 
embedding 
dimension 
. 
However, 
rate 
of 
decrease 
falls 
rapidly 
and 
EER 
becomes 
almost 
steady. 
Large 
dimension 
requires 
increase 
in 
computational 
cost. 
Thus, 
optimal 
value 
of 
embedding 
dimension 
is 
about 
6 
for 
this 
data 
set. 
Delay 
time 
should 
not 
be 
too 
large 
and 
also 
not 
too 
small 
in 
case 
of 
CTE. 
EER 
is 
improved 
at 
first 
with 
larger 
delay 
time 
in 
case 
of 
DTW, 
it 
soon 
becomes 
constant.

Thus, 
optimal 
delay 
time 
is 
around 
5 
in 
case 
of 
CTE 
or 
around 
9 
in 
case 
of 
DTW. 
Examining 
EER 
values 
separately 
for 
each 
writer 
we 
found 
that 
there 
exists 
some 
optimal 
values 
of 
embedding 
parameters 
for 
each 
writer 
which 
is 
evident 
from 
the 
results 
of 
CTE 
based 
approach. 
DTW 
based 
approach 
shows 
writer 
independent 
settings 
of 
embedding 
parameters 
and 
verification 
accuracies 
are 
better 
for 
larger 
values 
of 
embedding 
parameters 
m 
and 
. 
Based 
on 
above 
findings, 
we 
calculated 
the 
writer 
specific 
optimal 
embedding 
parameters 
with 
respect 
to 
EER. 
Figure

shows 
the 
difference 
of 
best 
EER 
between 
CTE 
and 
DTW 
for 
each 
writer. 
This 
graph 
shows 
that 
if 
bar 
is 
positive, 
then 
CTE 
has 
better 
perfomance 
than 
DTW 
according 
to 
EER. 
From 
Figure 
3, 
we 
find 
the 
following 



In 
case 
of 
time 
series, 
CTE 
performs 
better 
than 
DTW. 
Average 
of 
EER 
is 
0.096 
and 
0.114 
for 
CTE 
and 
DTW 
respectively. 
In 
case 
of 
time 
series 
, 
CTE 
performs 
slightly 
better 
than 
DTW. 
Average 
of 
EER 
is 
0.063 
and 
0.066 
for 
CTE 
and 
DTW 
respectively. 
CTE 
can 
achieve 
better

perfomance 
than 
DP 
by

CONCLUSION 
Here 
we 
proposed 
an 
approach 
for 
automatic 
identity 
detection 
for 
person 
authentication 
from 
dynamic 
biometric 
information. 
We 
used 
online 
signature 
verification 
as 
an 
application 
area 
of 
dynamic 
biometrics. 
The 
proposed 
approach 
considers 
the 
dynamics 
of 
hand 
movement 
and 
is 
based 
on 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
reconstruction 
of 
dynamics 
from 
the 
generated 
multivariable 
time 
series. 
A 
similarity 
measure 
CTE 
for 
measuring 
similarity 
of 
two 
trajectories 
has 
been 
proposed 
and 
applied 
to 
detect 
forgery 
from 
genuine 
handwritten 
signature. 
For 
evaluation 
of 
the 
proposed 
measure, 
popular 
DTW 
based 
algorithm 
for 
a 
single 
time 
series 
with 
multidimensional 
delay 
vector 
has 
been 
also 
applied 
to 
the 
same 
data 
set 
of 
online 
signature 
verification 
task. 


show 
that 
the 
multidimensional 
delay 
vector 
based 
approach 
for 
analysis 
of 
handwritten 
time 
series 
is 
effective 
as 
both 
the 
proposed 
measure 
and 
DTW 
with 
multidimensional 
delay 
vector 
produce 
improved 
result 
than 
conventional 
DTW 
for 
a 
single 
time 
series. 
The 
proposed 
measure 
is 
found 
to 
be 
more 
efficient 
in 
finding 
the 
identity 
of 
a 
person 
from 
his 
signature 
time 
series 
compared 
to 
popular 
DTW 
based 
measure.Speciallyit 
isfound 
that 
themeasure 
is 
veryeffective 
with 
writer 
specific 
setting 
of 
multidimensional 
delay 
vector. 
Considering 
the 
computational 
cost 
the 
algorithm 
based 
on 
proposed 
measure 
CTW 
has 
a 
linear 
growth 
with 
the 
length 
of 
data 
compared 
to 
polynomial 
growth 
of 
DTW 
based 
algorithm.
We 
are 
currently 
working 
on 
appropriate 
method 
of 
setting 
writer 
specific 
delay 
parameters 
to 
improve 
overall 
verification 
accuracy.
